    <h2 class="sec-title">Concept</h2>
    <ul>This dialogue has no predetermined theme or conclusion. What will emerge from the exchange of words between Masayuki Kawai, a video artist exploring practical aesthetics, and Atsushi Okada, an art historian who approaches art not only from art history but also from many other perspectives? By engaging in dialogue without a set direction, they may transcend the boundaries of thought and create new perspectives. What kind of chemical reactions will emerge from a dialogue between two people who move back and forth between different realms? We hope you will be there to witness it.</ul>
