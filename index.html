    <h2 class="sec-title">Concept</h2>
    <ul>Through the practice of video art, Masayuki Kawai explores aesthetics, while Atsushi Okada approaches art from multiple perspectives, including art history and philosophy. From each of their viewpoints, they will contemplate the concept of "Aida" (Something in betweenn). With the rapid development of daily information media, it feels as though society and individuals are gradually losing their flexibility. How can we open ourselves to the ambiguity and fluctuations within that "Something in between," without being distracted by the things that are immediately visible? By considering the practice and history of art and thought, the dialogue between the two may give rise to a new perspective. What kind of chemical reaction will emerge from their words crossing over different domains? We invite you to witness that moment.</ul>
